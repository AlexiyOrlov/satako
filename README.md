Satako is a library for Forge modding. It contains various useful things, UI system and various functions.

It also adds 3 commands to the game: `give2`, `summon2`
, `fill2` which let you specify namespace and path of the arguments separately.

If you want to develop mods using Satako or just need it as a dependency,
then let me know and I'll set up a maven repo for it.
